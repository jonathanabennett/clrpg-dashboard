### _Your Name <your.name@example.com>_

This the program I use as a digital GM screen when running my GURPS Dungeon Fantasy campaign.

Built using McCLIM and Common Lisp. Currently under HEAVY development, this is not even ready for alpha testing yet.

## Planned Features
1. Skill Roller. Click a skill and enter the situational mods to roll that skill and print out the results.
2. Combat Tracker. Track HP, FP, and penalties for each combatant.
3. NPC Tracker. NPC stats. Includes random generation.
4. Tables. Tables are read in from data files and can be used to roll for anything!
